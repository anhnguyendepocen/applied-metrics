*SUTVA and nonparametric regression* \hfill
*ARE213*: Section 02 \\ \\

The purpose of this section is to provide a numerical example for the
Stable Unit Value Treatment Assumption (SUTVA) and to present an
example of loess regression using =ggplot2=.  

* SUTVA

The very simple but fundamental assumption of stable unit treatment
values can be illustrated with a numerical example.  The notation is
fairly simple, but the numerical example made the concept much clearer
to me.  Let $\D$ be an $N \times 1$ column of treatment values, so
that $D_i$ is an indicator of treatment for observation $i = 1, 2,
\ldots, N$.  Let $\Dp$ be another vector which defines a different
treatment regime. Formally, SUTVA states that if $D_i = D_i^{\prime}$,
then $Y_i (\D) = Y_i (\Dp)$.  Less formally, SUTVA states that there
is no spillover effect from the treatment.  As stated in class, if
SUTVA does not hold, then there is not a singular treatment effect,
but rather the potential for an effect of a change in $D_i$ on all
observations $j = 1, 2, \ldots, N$, not just on the own observation
effect.  Consider the specific treatment vector $\D$:

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
  (D <- c(1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1))
#+end_src 

#+RESULTS:
:  [1] 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

Define the treatment effect to be determined by the random vector
$\x$.  This, if there were no spillover at all, $Y_i(1) = x_i$ and
$Y_i(0) = 0$.  However, we induce spillover by defining the treatment
effect to depend on a rolling function.  Specifically, define
$Y_i(D_i) = \max\{D_{i+1}, D_i\} \cdot x_i$.  The following applies
this rule, and then prints the value of the treatment for $i = 7$.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
  library(zoo)
  x <- runif(10)
  Y <- rollmax(D, 2, fill = 1) * x
  print(Y[7])
#+end_src 

#+results:
: [1] 0

Now suppose we adjust the treatment regime by setting $D_8 = 1$. Under
both regimes, $D_7 = D^{\prime}_7 = 0$, such that if SUTVA were to
hold, we should observe $Y_7(\D) = Y_7(\Dp)$.  This is not the case,
however, since the value of $D_8$ informs the treatment effect of the
seventh observation.  

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
  D[8] <- 1
  Y <- rollmax(D, 2, fill = 1) * x
  print(Y[7])
#+end_src 

#+results:
: [1] 0.7788191

When the treatment effect of one observation depends on the treatment
of another observation, then SUTVA does not hold.  We are unable to
estimate the treatment effect relative to the "no intervention"
scenario.  This is a relatively simple example, but it's conceivable
that the effect across observations may be much more complicated.

* Poorly defined treatments

Suppose that the value of the treatment is a function of the level of
the outcome variable.  This may seem a little circular, but consider a
situation where the market for the outcome adjusts based on the total
activity in that market.  What if the individual treatment effect is a
function of the level of the aggregate outcome?  The treatment is
poorly defined, and it may be difficult to settle on a coneptual idea
of the treatment effect, let alone an empirical assessment.  Suppose
for example, that the treatment effect for each individual is $x_i
\cdot (\sum_i Y_i)^{-1}$.  Ignore the timing of the treatment for now,
and assume that the iterative adjustment process is condensed into a
single time period. The higher aggregate treatment effect will induce
a shift of the market supply, perhaps, and lower the individual
treatment effect --- a sort of congestion effect.  \\

The following example illustrates this point.  We can calculate the
treatment effects for each of the ten individuals, which is a function
of the aggregate treatment effect.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
  D <- c(1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1)
  x <- runif(10)
  (Y <- D * x * 1/sum(D * x))
#+end_src 

#+results:
:  [1] 0.18658768 0.00000000 0.18340310 0.00000000 0.08281655 0.00000000
:  [7] 0.22954113 0.08917835 0.00000000 0.22847320

If the market responds to the aggregate level of treatment --- which
it does by construction --- then by changing the treatment regime so
that observation $i = 2$ now receives treatment, the effect will be
felt by all other individuals.  Note that the treatment effects for
the other observations are slightly lower with the restricted change
in the treatment regime.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
  D[2] <- 1
  (Y <- D * x * 1/sum(D * x))
#+end_src 

#+results:
:  [1] 0.16208346 0.13132815 0.15931711 0.00000000 0.07194040 0.00000000
:  [7] 0.19939592 0.07746672 0.00000000 0.19846823

* Loess figures in ggplot2

We will learn more about nonparametric regression later in the course.
Plotting the loess regression may suggest a model specification that
may not be immediately apparent.  Take, for example, the relationship
between birthweight and maternal age.  We can read in the data and
take a random sample of 5,000, just to speed things up a bit.  

#+begin_src R :exports code :results none
  library(ggplot2)
  data <- read.csv("../../../resources/ps1.csv")
  var.names <- c("dbrwt", "dmage")
  idx <- sample.int(nrow(data), 5000)
  sm.data <- data[idx, var.names]
#+end_src 

#+RESULTS:

The loess model is a specific variant of locally weighted scatterplot
smoothing regression analysis.  Note that this is very similar to the
lowess model, which are separated only by the smoothing technique.
When all observations are given equal weight over the domain, both
loess and lowess are equivalent to simple linear regression.  However,
locally weighted regression analysis place higher weight on "nearby"
observations.  The specification of what constitutes "nearby"
observations and the method of weighting distinguishes the various
models.  Mostly, the following just presents examples that are useful
for learning =ggplot2=.  Fig. \ref{fig:loess} presents the loess
curve on its own, and Fig. \ref{fig:fit} presents the same curve
with the scatterplot points.

#+CAPTION: Loess regression
#+LABEL: fig:loess 
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file fig1.png :width 700 :height 400 :session :tangle yes :exports both
  (p <- ggplot(sm.data, aes(x=dmage, y=dbrwt)) + geom_smooth(method = "loess", size = 1.5))
#+end_src 

#+RESULTS:
[[file:fig1.png]]

The curve in Fig. \ref{fig:loess} suggests that the relationship
between maternal age and infant birthweight may be quadratic.  Mothers
that are relatively young and old may give birth to lighter babies,
potentially indicating poorer infant health.  Moreover, the confidence
intervals are wider toward the tails of the age distribution, since
there are fewer observations in these age ranges.  To examine the
curve in context of the actual observations, we can add the actual
data as a scatterplot in Fig. \ref{fig:fit}.

#+CAPTION: Loess regression with scatter plot

  p + geom_point()
#+end_src 

#+RESULTS:
[[file:fig2.png]]

The quadratic relationship is interesting, and we can show that it is
statistically significant, but even for the small subsample of the
data, the loess model explains only a small portion of the variation
in birthweight.
