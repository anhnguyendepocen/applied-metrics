*Interpretation of Coefficients and R Review* \hfill
*ARE213*: Section 01 \\ \\

The purpose of this section is twofold: (1) Basic review of the
interpretation of coefficients on common, linear models that we will
encounter in class. (2) Introduction and quick review of useful =R=
code to help with problem sets.  The section notes are an open-source,
Github project, which can be found here.  The text is an =org-mode=
document, which can be compiled as HTML or \LaTeX.  The text is
interactive, if you are an Emacs user: you can run the =R= code from
within the document, and then compile the results immediately.
